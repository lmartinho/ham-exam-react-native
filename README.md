## Amateur Radio Exam (Portugal) App

React native app to get ready for my Category 2 [Ham Operator License exam](https://www.anacom.pt/render.jsp?categoryId=384682) in Portugal.

I'm now a Category 2 Amateur Radio Operator - callsign CS7ARV.
~~I'm currently a Category 3 Ham Operator - callsign CR7ARV - which does not have broadcast privileges.~~

This app starts from [ReactNativeSchool](https://github.com/ReactNativeSchool)'s [react-native-quiz app](https://github.com/ReactNativeSchool/react-native-quiz) app, and packages the sample questions provided by ANACOM.


Credits for the questions go to ANACOM. According to ANACOM credits should be to Jorge Azevedo, José Sá e Luís Pizarro (callsigns CT1DOF, CT1EEB, and CT1DJG, respectively).
