React native app to get ready for my Category 2 Ham Operator License exam in Portugal.

I'm currently a Category 3 Ham Operator - callsign CR7ARV - which does not have broadcast privileges.

This app starts from ReactNativeSchool's react-native-quiz app, and packages the sample questions provided by ANACOM.

Credits for the questions go to ANACOM. According to ANACOM credits should be to Jorge Azevedo, José Sá e Luís Pizarro (callsigns CT1DOF, CT1EEB, and CT1DJG, respectively).

You can learn more here (in pt-PT):

DISCLAIMER:
I provide no warranty on the accuratecy or correctness of the questions, answers, and, especially, the solutions.
While questions and answers are sourced from ANACOM, the solutions are mine and have not been verified. I tried my best, and will undergo the exame assuming those are the right answers.
